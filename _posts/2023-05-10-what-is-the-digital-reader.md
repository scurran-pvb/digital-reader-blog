Teachers are able to use the digital books to share via online instruction by way of their own prerecorded lessons, or they can <a href="#">assign titles for the student</a> to retrieve and read through the studentâ€™s own account access. Books may only be read when logged into this account-based website platform; the titles are not available for download.
