NEW! We’ve just added a brand-new feature that will provide students with structure and support during independent reading and center time: Reading Adventures! Each Reading Adventure begins with a word study activity followed by a video book introduction to ensure that your student is prepared to read. The adventure concludes with your student reading their assigned title independently.

Let’s see where the road takes us! Watch the video to get a peek!
